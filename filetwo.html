            <p>Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the
                way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means
                of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation.
                Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear
                in a printed document.
                This
                is
                Cool.
